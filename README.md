# Welcome to the GoT API

This project has long since been at the back of my head. Ever since I first started learning how to program, I've wanted to
consume API data from a REST API. Fastforward to today, and now I
can build my own API from scratch, which has led me and motivated
me to create this.

# # Inspirations for this project

A close friend is truly the reason for this project, without
them, I would have had far less of a reason to create this
project. I am not an avid Game of Thrones fan, infact I may never
watch the show ever, but the person who inspired me to code,
among other things aswell, inspired this project, and motivated me to keep looking ahead toward the future.

## How to get started using the GoT API

All documentation will be in this READ.ME aswell as in the API
itself, and potentially on my blog.
